Test test. Is this thing on?

So I have a new website!

If anyone from SumOfUs is reading this, I wasn't actually prepared to put this site up yet. I found your job listing about 6 hours before the application deadline. I spent the next 6 hours creating a new resume (two actually because the first one was having some issues converting to pdf), creating the rest of this site, and answering your questions the best I could.

What I'm trying to say is that I would really like to work with you. I already enjoy making things, but when you mix in that "fight the power" vibe that you guys have, it is incredibly motivating and inspiring. Hopefully we'll talk soon!
