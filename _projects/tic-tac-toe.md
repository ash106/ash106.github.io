[Demo](https://sheltered-caverns-30642.herokuapp.com/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/ash106/tic-tac-toe)

Built with React, Rails, Bootstrap and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

I improved and expanded on [this](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) basic tic tac toe code:

- Refactored into container and presentational components
- Uses a Rails API to store game data
- New features (restart button, highlighting a win)
- Styled with Bootstrap 4
- Animated D3 donut chart component uses ActionCable to show real time stats
